        <h1>FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>
            Frontend development is where creativity meets code. It's about bringing designs to life, turning pixels into interactions, and crafting digital experiences that look good and feel even better. From HTML and CSS foundations to dynamic JavaScript wizardry, the frontend is what users see, touch, and vibe with every time they visit a site. Basically, it’s the ✨ face ✨ of the web—and you’re the artist behind it.

                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more, acting as the foundation of all websites.
